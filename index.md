## Who are we? And who is this group for?

We are ordinary R users, who use open source tools to perform data analytics and data science in both academia and industry.
And we want to connect people like users like us.

If you use R for data analytics, data science, research, business intelligence, or modelling, you are most welcome.
*New R users* are also welcome, but we do not focus on introductory materiale, but refer to http://au-cru.github.io.
